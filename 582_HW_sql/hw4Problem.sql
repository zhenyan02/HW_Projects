  Construct the database schema, insert the rows and write SQL queries for the problems given. The results that you should be getting for these queries are given to you for verifying your queries.
  If your query does not compile (there is an error in your SQL statement), you must mention that.
  Also if your query generates a different result than given, you must again mention that. (Note that the order of the result rows are insignificant, unless there is an ORDER BY clause).
  For each problem, indicate your confidence level on a scale from 0 .. 10, with 0 indicating the lowest level of confidence, and 10 indicating the highest level of confidence.
