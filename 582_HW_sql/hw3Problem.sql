Schema Preparation/Data insertion -- same as for HW2

Consider the following simplified data warehouse schema for a store with internet sales. Sample data is given in a separate excel sheet -- you need to create the tables and load the data into Oracle (or) any other DB server that you are using.

CREATE TABLE SalesTerritory (
	SalesTerritoryKey int PRIMARY KEY,
	SalesTerritoryRegion varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	SalesTerritoryCountry varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	SalesTerritoryGroup varchar(50)
);
CREATE TABLE ProductSubcategory (
	ProductSubcategoryKey int PRIMARY KEY,
	ProductSubcategoryName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	ProductCategoryKey int
);
CREATE TABLE ProductCategory (
	ProductCategoryKey int PRIMARY KEY,
	ProductCategoryName varchar(50) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Product (
	ProductKey int PRIMARY KEY,
	ProductSubcategoryKey int REFERENCES ProductSubcategory,
	ProductName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	Color varchar(15) NOT NULL,
	StandardCost NUMBER,
	DealerPrice NUMBER,
	ListPrice NUMBER,
	ProductSize varchar(50),
	ModelName varchar(50)
);
CREATE TABLE InternetSales (
	SalesOrderNumber varchar(20) NOT NULL,
	ProductKey int NOT NULL REFERENCES Product,
	OrderDate int NOT NULL,
	SalesTerritoryKey int NOT NULL REFERENCES SalesTerritory,
	OrderQuantity int NOT NULL,
	UnitPrice NUMBER NOT NULL
);

For each question, I list the problem and the expected answers (remember that the order of rows and order of columns might be different in some cases).

For each question, list your confidence level on a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 indicating lowest level of confidence and 10 indicating the highest level of confidence.

Grading. Qns 1 - 4: 0.5 pt each. Qns 5 - 12. 1 pt each.
